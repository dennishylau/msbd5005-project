    Before the economic reforms in 1978, China maintained Soviet style,
    centrally planned economy. A large share of the countryâ€™s industrial
    output was directed and controlled by state owned enterprises, which
    are often bureaucractic and inefficient at distributing resources.


    China's economy also suffered a series of setbacks throughout 1960 to 1976,
    either due to political turmoil or natural diasaters. Including but not limited

    The compounded effects of these events is a rocky growth curve, GDP growth 
    periodically shift between positive and negative in years before 1978. 
    In 1978, then Chinese premiere, Ding Xiaoping annouced a plan for economic
    reform, under which we would see China adopting free-market principles and
    eventually become the current economic power house. But on what basis was
    this reform based on?

demographic_1960 = """
    At the beginning of the 60's, China's demographic is very young, with over 
    half of its population under the age of 20. Traditional wisdom suggests
    that a young population is the bed-rock of an economy, this is 
    particularly true for countries industrial output depends largly on
    manual work, such as China.

    If we take a look at China's population pyramid in 1960, it takes the 
    shape of what is known as a "expansive population", meaning the fertility 
    rates are high and lower life expectancies. A society with an "expansive 
    population", will be able to offer cost competitive labour and a ticket
    to get wealthy. Of course, this also depends on the investment and political
    environment. That is why even though China has an expansive pyramid in much
    of the 60s to 70s, it didn't amount to any significant economic growth.

    Moving into 1980s, the bulk of Chinese population is moving into tax paying 
    age group, acompanied by Ding's economic reform policies, China is in a 
    very good position to welcome an incoming economic boom. 

    Interestingly, the year 1980 was when the Chinese Government implemented the
    infamous "One Child Policy" in the year 1980. A policy that will haunt 
    the country for years to come. We shall revisit this topic in later chapters.
