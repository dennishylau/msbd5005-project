    Before the economic reforms in 1978, China maintained Soviet style,
    centrally planned economy. A large share of the countryâ€™s industrial
    output was directed and controlled by state owned enterprises, which
    are often bureaucractic and inefficient at distributing resources.

    China also experienced various types of events that saw its growth hindered.
    Hover the graph on the right to see more. 

    As a result, China's economic development during the 1960s to 1970s
    was miniscule.

    Comparing the annual GDP of China to countries like Japan and India, we
    can get a glimpse of its growth relative to other countries at the
    same time period. All three countries shared a similar GDP at the start,
    Japan's GDP growth started to diverge around 1965, while China's growth
    maintained more or less the same as India's.

econ_summary_1960 = """
    We can summarize the vicennial of economic development by taking GDP 
    percent difference between 1960 and 1980. It's obvious that China's
    economic development was lackluster in this time period. However, all 
    is about to change in the following years.

demographic_1960 = r"""
    At the beginning of the 60's, much of China's population 
    is skewed towards the young side, with over X% of the 
    being in between 0 - 15 years old. We can see a steady 
    growth in the workforce as the years go by. By the 1980's,
    China's workforce has grown to Y.

    China's large and young population can provide cost 
    competitive labour, which benefits its 
    efforts to open up its economy and in the late 70's.

    Interestingly, the Chinese Communist Party implemented the
    infamous "One Child Policy" in the year 1980. We will 
    see the policy's effects on the population and China's 
    economic future in later chapters.
